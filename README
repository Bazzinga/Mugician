LICENSE: You can submit changes to this repository, but please do it on your own branch for my sanity's sake.  
If you submit something to Apple, at least change the name and app id, and MAKE SURE that your app and Mugician can be co-installed on the same iPad.

1) Give me credit for your code being a fork of Mugician.

2) DON'T BREAK MY EXISTING MUGICIAN USERS PLEASE.  

3) Don't confuse my users.  Mugician is my trademark.  Come up with your own name.  

NOTE: You cannot submit this as it is to the Apple Store even if you changed the name and app id.  It does things that need to be commented out before you can do that.
